### Hi there üëã ‚ú®

<h1 align="center"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="28">I am a Senior Full-Stack / Blockchain Developer</h1>

When problems surface, I methodically turn them into opportunities.

My stewardship keeps me intensely rooted from ideation to code with the intensity for focusing on methodologies that maximize outputs and minimizes inputs. By setting into motion, a ‚Äúmentoring is implied‚Äù culture in a self-governing environment influenced by the strict practice of agile principles, a center of gravity begins to form around the requirements.

The anatomy of my approach, the composition of strategic units that delivers consistent results with discipline & maturity is the foundation for attracting exceptionally smart people, that you can remarkably trust. What this will achieve will blow you away!

Today‚Äôs proliferation of technology necessitates a paradigm shift in talent acquisition where being multi-disciplined is a pre-requisite, and having a healthy disregard for the status quo is now a stipulation.

Fully embracing my autodidactic nature has facilitated the rapid ability to educate myself to advanced levels beyond the attainability of the traditional outlets in today‚Äôs industry. Because of this, I excel naturally in multi-disciplined environments, roles & capacities.

- ‚ö° I roll deep in JS frameworks(React, Angular, Vue, etc), AWS services, Backend development(Laravel, Django, Node)
- üí¨ Ask me about how to create resilient and scalable architectures üòÑ
